    },
    "q2": {

      "question": "Do you provide riding equipment?",
      "answer": "We provide helmets and safety vests at no extra cost. For regular students, we recommend purchasing riding boots and pants for comfort. We can advise on where to buy quality gear locally."

    "q4": {
      "question": "Can I choose my instructor?",

    "q5": {
      "question": "What's the difference between group and private lessons?",

      "question": "Can adults with no experience join?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We have many adult beginners. Our adult programs focus on building confidence at your own pace in a supportive, non-judgmental environment. Age is just a number!"
